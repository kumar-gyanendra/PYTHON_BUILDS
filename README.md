# 🐍 PYTHON_BUILDS

A collection of Python programs, scripts, experiments, and daily builds created to improve coding skills, explore new concepts, and develop practical tools.

## 📘 Overview

**PYTHON_BUILDS** is a structured collection of Python solutions to coding problems from various competitive programming and interview preparation platforms.
This repository serves as a personal practice archive where I solve, store, and review problems to improve my Python skills, strengthen my logic, and prepare for technical assessments.

The goal of this repository is to:

- Build a strong foundation in Python problem-solving
- Practice algorithms and data structures through real coding challenges
- Organize solutions by platform for easy reference
- Maintain a record of my learning journey
- Provide clean, readable, and well-structured Python solutions
- This repository grows gradually as I solve new problems from multiple platforms such as LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeChef, Codeforces, and more.
